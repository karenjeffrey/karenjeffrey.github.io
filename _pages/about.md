I'm a Political Economist and Data Scientist. I have a PhD in Political Economy from King's College London and have worked as a Research Fellow in Medical Informatics, and as a Researcher for a think tank, a consultancy, the NHS, and the BBC.

I'm passionate about analysing data to uncover new insights. I'm particularly interested in researching the impacts of artificial intelligence on labour markets and the response in voters' policy preferences.
