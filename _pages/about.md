**Background**

I’m a Political Economist and Data Scientist. During a PhD in Political Economy at King’s College London, I investigated the economic and political consequences of AI-driven automation. I then completed a Postdoc in Medical Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, gaining advanced data science and machine learning skills while investigating the prevalence and risk factors for long COVID. 


**Research interests**

My research explores how societies can benefit from AI, while effectively managing the risks posed. I'm particularly interested in:

•  Measuring AI's impact on labor markets and economic inequality

•  Monitoring changes in public opinion and policy preferences in response to AI adoption

•  Developing evidence-based policies to manage workforce transitions and mitigate AI-related risks

I'm also interested in refining approaches to measurement and research methods. I'm particularly passionate about using data to uncover insights that shape better policies, including leveraging survey data to understand people’s lived experiences.
