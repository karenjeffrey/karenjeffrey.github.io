I’m a Political Economist and Data Scientist with a PhD from King’s College London. My research explores how societies can maximise the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) while effectively managing the risks posed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I carried out research into long COVID, including developing predictive models of individual risk.

Working with organisations such as the University of Edinburgh, the NHS, the BBC, and the New Economics Foundation, I've gained extensive experience in data analysis, causal inference, and policy research. I’m particularly passionate about using data to uncover insights that shape better policies, including leveraging survey data to understand people’s lived experiences.

My current research interests focus on:

•  Measuring AI's impact on labor markets and economic inequality

•  Monitoring changes in public opinion and policy preferences in response to AI adoption

•  Developing evidence-based policies to manage workforce transitions and mitigate AI-related risks
