I’m a Political Economist and Data Scientist with a PhD from King’s College London. My research focuses on understanding how societies can harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) while mitigating its risks.

Working at the University of Edinburgh, the NHS, the BBC, and the New Economics Foundation, I've gained skills in data analysis and policy research. I'm passionate about using data to uncover new insights, including leveraging survey data to understand about people's lived experiences.

My research interests include:

•  Measuring AI's impact on labor markets

•  Monitoring shifts in public opinion and policy preferences in response to AI

•  Developing evidence-based policy responses to AI
