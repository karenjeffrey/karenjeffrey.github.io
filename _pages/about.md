I’m a Political Economist and Data Scientist. PhD in Political Economy from King’s College London. Postdoc in Medical Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. 


**Research interests**

My research explores how societies can benefit from AI, while effectively managing the risks posed. I'm particularly interested in:

•  Measuring AI's impact on labor markets and economic inequality

•  Monitoring changes in public opinion and policy preferences in response to AI adoption

•  Developing evidence-based policies to manage workforce transitions and mitigate AI-related risks

Also interested in refining approaches to measurement and research methods. Passionate about using data to uncover insights that shape better policies, including leveraging survey data to understand people’s lived experiences.
